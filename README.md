# Activity Tracker App Engine
### App engine cloud sync for ActivityTracker

This is the google cloud app engine for the Activity Tracker application written in Java. The purpose of this app engine is to upload your activity directly into the cloud for cloud storage and access.

When the user clicks “Sync”, all local history entries will be uploaded to Google App Engine. Users can view the entry from browser. When the user clicks one entry’s “DELETE” button, the entry should be deleted both remotely on the cloud and locally on the phone. 

Below is an image of the architecture of the app engine: http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~campbell/cs65/myruns/image/app_engine.jpg
